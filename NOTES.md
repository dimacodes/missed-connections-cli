#TODO:

1. Improve functionality to include:

- launch function (uncensored version):
"Type view to launch in your browser"

<!-- def launch_post
    index = @input.to_i - 1
    post = MissedConnections::Post.all[index]
    Launchy.open(post.url)
end -->

- find by keyword
<!-- def find_by_keyword
array, iterate, find word
end -->

2. Bundle gem, publish to RubyGems
